## Summary

My main goal is to become a programmer. I started to get involved in programming since the age of 14, and of course it was an HTML. I watched various video tutorials on YouTube, tried to find some information about layout, and so on and so force. But one day I wanted to go to offline courses and my choice fell on the IT Academy "STEP". I chose a course and began to study. I learned a lot of things, the basics of working with networks, then the basics of python, then C ++, the basics of html / css + JavaScript and the jQuery library. Now Iâ€™m studying working with databases and the .NET platform there, however, I began to lose interest in C # because I was completely determined and realized that I want to become a frontend developer. I heard that there is such a site training.by, and found a course on frontend development there. I hope that i can achive something with these courses. For example, get a job in EPAM.
